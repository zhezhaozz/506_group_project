# 506_group_project

This repo includes the group project work by Group 5. Our group members are Zhe Zhao, Tian Wang, and Hyesue Jang.


The key question: Is working overtime associated with blood pressure levels?


Core analysis: multiple linear regression with 3 cycle of two-year survey data (2011-2012, 2013-2014, and 2015-2016).


Tools used by each members:
- Zhe: R (data.table for data manipulation, base regression functions for model fitting)
- Tian: Python (pandas for data manipulation, sklearn/statsmodels for model fitting)
- Hyesue: R (dplyr for data manipulation, base regression functions and gls function from nlme for model fitting)


Collaboration: We worked on our own branch and checked each other's code by pulling the repo (and all branches). 
Final works were merged to the master.
