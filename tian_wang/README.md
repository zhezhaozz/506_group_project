# 506_group_project
Author: Tian Wang

This README.md explains the individual files included in "tian_wang" folder.

This is a personal folder for the work completed by Tian Wang. The work was done as a part of STATS506 (Fall 2019) Group Project.

Project Report Draft.Rmd, Project Report Draft.html and Project Report Draft.pdf are the draft for the core analysis part of our project written by me.

STATS506_Project.ipynb and STATS506_Project.html include all the Python codes for the whole project.

STATS506_Project_Core_Additional_Analysis.html and STATS506_Project_Core_Additional_Analysis.ipynb include the Python codes for the core analysis and additional analysis.

cleaned_data.csv has the dataset used for the analysis.

Note: Since the "STATS506_Project_Core_Additional_Analysis" file needs to be inserted into the final report, I didn't include a header and a description for it as we may not be able to hide codes in the Jupyter notebook. In addtion, since the "Project Report Draft" file was just a draft, I didn't include a header and a description for it as we revised it later and put the contents into our report. However, the "STATS506_Project" file includes all the required contents.
